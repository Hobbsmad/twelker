        Employee retention is a critical issue facing today's organizations as they compete for talent in a recovering economy. According to Bersin by Deloitte, the costs of employee turnover are increasingly high, as much as 1.5 to 2 times an employee's salary. There are also other costs, such as lowered productivity and a decrease in employee morale. These all add up to big challenges for organizations that aren't investing in their human capital. A recent Aerotek study identified some of the biggest benefits of employee development: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>67 percent higher engagement levels</li>
        <li>61 percent greater efficiencies</li>
        <li>30 percent lower turnover</li>
        <li>65 percent of employees say the quality of training and learning opportunities positively influences their engagement</li>
      </ul>
